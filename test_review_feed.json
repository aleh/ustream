They took my harsh comments in stride and handled the issue promptly, sending me a new device that is compatible with their updated app. All of their responses were prompt and courteous. The new device and app have worked fine on the first two uses, however, I must say that the app could still use some tweaking. The original iGrill app gave you a choice of alarms, which was handy as you could pick one that might be easier to hear in a noisy environment. I find the current chirping alarm with no other options to be a little annoying. It would also be nice to be able to adjust the target temp on the fly instead of having to start over, if you decide that you or a guest would like their food a little more done. Fortunately, the graph doesn’t start over in the case that you have to do that. I could live with those annoyances, however, if it means that I don’t run into surprises every time I use the app and see that the latest update forces me to have to do or relearn something just to throw some meat on the grill.

I am suffering from the same functionality issues as everyone here reviewing this APP, including a loss pairing at short range and I have no real consistency on long range. This APP makes this device completely useless for my intended use. I was happy, but, alas, I no longer am. Weber, it would be nice to see you learn from your decades of business in the grilling business...\n\nAmendment: Please bring back the iDevice APP for the iGrill 2 NOW!!! At least it worked! You can use the new buyers for your acquired iGrill 2 for experimentation and let us old timers get by with a superior product that is light years in quality, benefits, and features better than the Weber developed APP!!!
